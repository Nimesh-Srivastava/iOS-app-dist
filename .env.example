# GitHub Personal Access Token must have full "repo" scope to delete repositories
# Format can be just the token, or prefixed with "Bearer " or "token "
# To generate a new token:
# 1. Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens
# 2. Create a new token with "Repository permissions" > "Administration: Read and write"
# 3. Replace this token with the newly generated one
# Note: Classic tokens with "repo" scope also work
